## 💻 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to include the Fitzy Library to your website.

First include the dependency in your project.

Fitzy is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fitzy).

```bash
$ npm install fitzy --save
```

> This library depends on `react`,`prop-types` and `Emotion`. Please make sure you
> have those installed as well.

## 📦 Usage

The `fitzy` library provides both named and default exports, so you can import everything or just what you need. I would recommend just to import what you need for smaller bundle sizes.

##### Named:

```js
import { Input, Tabs } from 'fitzy';
```

##### Default:

```js
import Fitzy from 'fitzy';
```
